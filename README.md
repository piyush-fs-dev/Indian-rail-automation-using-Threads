# QUESTION  #

IndianRail has decided to improve its efficiency by automating not just its trains but also
its passengers. Each passenger and each train is controlled by a thread. You have been hired
to write synchronization functions that will guarantee orderly loading of trains. You must
define a structure struct station, plus several functions described below.
When a train arrives in the station and has opened its doors, it invokes the function
# station_load_train(struct station *station, int count) 
where count indicates how many seats are available on the train. The function must not return
until the train is satisfactorily loaded (all passengers are in their seats, and either the train is
full or all waiting passengers have boarded).
When a passenger arrives in a station, it first invokes the function
# station_wait_for_train(struct station *station)
This function must not return until a train is in the station (i.e., a call to station_load_train is
in progress) and there are enough free seats on the train for this passenger to sit down. Once
this function returns, the passenger robot will move the passenger on board the train and into
a seat (you do not need to worry about how this mechanism works). Once the passenger is
seated, it will call the function
# station_on_board(struct station *station)
to let the train know that it's on board.
Create a file IndianRail.c that contains a declaration for struct station and defines the three
functions above, plus the function station_init, which will be invoked to initialize the station
object when IndianRail boots. In addition:
You must write your solution in C using locks and condition variables:
lock_init (struct lock *lock)
........................................................etc.


# to run the program
First, you need to clone the code into your VM (virtual machine) or local machine: 
==> https://github.com/P-blaze/Indian-rail-automation-using-Threads

*Then compile the code by runnig ==>
# make

*now to run the program use ==>
# ./run
